# 3D-Array-Car-Park
A 16 year old studying A-Level Computer Science, a task was to create a car parking system to with multiple functions.
I might've gone a bit overkill with this, as although the rest of the class coded their car parks in Python, I decided to challenge myself to program this in C++, and my friend Amil suggested the idea of 3D Arrays, which I thought was crazy to begin with, but we decided to implement this as the 3rd Axis being the floor number.
Anyways - this took me a week to program, and I think the time complexity isn't great, as there are 2 nested for loops within a for loop, making it O(n^3) time complexity. 
The reason why I did this in C++ was because my main interest is creating programs, which is done with languages such as C++/C. Will I learn C someday? Potentially. 
If you, the user could find any suggestions to fix or improve the code, that would be amazing and I'll be grateful.
Thank you for reading!
